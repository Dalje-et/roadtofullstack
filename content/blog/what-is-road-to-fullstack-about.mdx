Well, here we are, my first ever blog post! üéâ

Let me start with a short paragraph about myself before I start explaining what this blog is about. My name is Daljeet
and at the time of writing I work as a Software Engineer at an application performance monitoring and observability
company called <a href="http://instana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@Instana</a>. Furthermore, I am currently
working on my Master thesis and hope to graduate in a few months.

The reason why I created this blog is that I always wanted to write down what I experience at the beginning of my career
in order to look back at some point and see what I have already done. I believe this is a great way to reflect on myself.
It also gives me the ability to deepen my knowledge because once I start writing about a topic I am destined to do more
research about it. At least that is how it is supposed to be, isn‚Äôt it? Besides, when I started to create this page
(November 2020) the second wave of Covid hit Germany pretty hard and places started to close again. So why not use the
time during quarantine and do something productive? üòõ

So what can you expect from this blog? Well, there are a couple of things. Firstly, I will write about software development
and maybe the technologies I encounter in my day-to-day life as a Software Engineer. Secondly, my goal is to share the
process of becoming a Fullstack Engineer. I do not think that this process only consists of learning the required tools 
and technologies, but instead it is also a new thought process one has to acquire. But at the end of the day, I am just a 
clueless guy, so I might be wrong here. We will see. Anyways, I already laid out some topics and thought I can share them 
on my first post (this will also force me to actually pursue those topics since I make an official commitment here):

* <b>How to develop a cross-platform mobile application.</b> This has been lingering in my mind for a long time now
as I think this can be a great challenge. Aside from a small university project three years ago (gosh I feel old now)
I have never ever built a proper mobile application. I am thinking about making a series that will describe the whole
process of creating such an app. I am talking design creation, reasons behind architectural decisions, and more.

* <b>Observations I make at the beginning of my career.</b> As mentioned before, I just started out as a full-time 
Software Engineer. There are a lot of things that are quite unique to me so I guess it could be cool to write about that.

* <b>Random tech stuff.</b> Be it a dope CSS trick I just learnt, some full-blown React components, or some database
migration testing in Java, this category will include different technical tutorials/blog posts on how to achieve certain
things.

* <b>Self development.</b> In my opinion, this category will be the "heart" of this blog. In the coming months there
will be a lot of change as I evolve more and more in my current role. I am not quite sure what exactly 
will happen but I certainly hope for new impulses and hope I can write about those new impulses in this blog.

I think that's it for now. There are of course more ideas that I have for this page but for now I will not make
them public since I will be pressured to get everything done as soon as possible. If you want to know what I plan I
guess you have to revisit this page every once in a while, which I would greatly appreciate of course.

I want to finish this first blog post with some exciting news! A few days ago, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-11-18-IBM-to-Acquire-Instana-as-Company-Continues-to-Advance-its-Hybrid-Cloud-and-AI-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM announced the agreement to acquire Instana</a>,
the company I work for. While I do not know what this will mean specifically for me and the work I do, I am excited and
very much looking forward to the coming months. Let's hope the future cooperation will be fruitful for the companies
(and of course this blog üòÅ).
